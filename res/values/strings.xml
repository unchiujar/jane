    <string name="help_text">Jane is a navigation application based on
from the XKCD author Randall Munroe. To navigate to a destination one only needs to know
the direction in hour format (at six o'clock, at 2 o'clock. etc) and the distance
to the destination. Jane provides a screen off navigation solution by speaking the
direction and distance to a destination. The destination and waypoints to the destination
can be imported from a file or add directly from the application. If imported from a file
the waypoints are in latitude longitude info format, with each waypoint on a different line.  </string>
